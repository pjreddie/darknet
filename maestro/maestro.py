#---------------------------
# Maestro Servo Controller
#---------------------------
#
# Support for the Pololu Maestro line of servo controllers
#
# Steven Jacobs -- Aug 2013
# https://github.com/FRC4564/Maestro/
#
# These functions provide access to many of the Maestro's capabilities using the
# Pololu serial protocol
#
class Controller:
    # When connected via USB, the Maestro creates two virtual serial ports
    # /dev/ttyACM0 for commands and /dev/ttyACM1 for communications.
    # Be sure the Maestro is configured for "USB Dual Port" serial mode.
    # "USB Chained Mode" may work as well, but hasn't been tested.
    #
    # Pololu protocol allows for multiple Maestros to be connected to a single
    # serial port. Each connected device is then indexed by number.
    # This device number defaults to 0x0C (or 12 in decimal), which this module
    # assumes.  If two or more controllers are connected to different serial
    # ports, or you are using a Windows OS, you can provide the tty port.  For
    # example, '/dev/ttyACM2' or for Windows, something like 'COM3'.
    def __init__(self,ttyStr='/dev/ttyACM0',device=0x0c):
        # Open the command port
        self.usb = serial.Serial(ttyStr)

        self.PololuCmd = chr(0xaa) + chr(device)
        # Track target position for each servo. The function isMoving() will
        # use the Target vs Current servo position to determine if movement is
        # occuring.  Upto 24 servos on a Maestro, (0-23). Targets start at 0.
        self.Targets = [0] * 24
        # Servo minimum and maximum targets can be restricted to protect components.
